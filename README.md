# Learn Nextjs | **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**'s course

> Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Nextjs course : [**Next.js & React - The Complete Guide (incl. Two Paths!).**](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/)

## Description

Learn NextJS from the ground up and build production-ready, fullstack ReactJS apps with the NextJS framework!

**This course will take you from NextJS beginner to advanced level in no time!**

We'll start at the very basics, no NextJS knowledge is required at all, and we'll then dive into all the core features that make up NextJS. Both in theory as well as with **multiple real projects** where all concepts will be applied step-by-step.

For this course, you'll need **basic React knowledge**, though the course does come with a **"React refresher" module** in case it's been some time since you last worked with React.

This course also includes a **"NextJS Summary" module** which allows you to always come back to the course in the future and refresh your knowledge without going through the full course again. Or you just take that summary module (and skip the rest for now) to learn about all the core features in as little time as possible.

After finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own NextJS projects from the ground up and apply for NextJS positions!

**In detail, this course will cover:**

- What is NextJS? And why would you use it?

- Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?

- Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects

- Working with file-based routing

- Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes

- Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering

- Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps

- Pre-generating dynamic and static pages

- Adding optimizations like metadata to pages

- Optimizing images with the NextJS Image component

- Building fullstack apps with API routes

- Managing app-wide state with React context (in NextJS apps)

- Adding authentication to NextJS apps

- Multiple complete apps where we'll apply all these core concepts!

- A complete React.js refresher module (so that we're all on the same page)

- A NextJS summary module so that you can refresh what you learned or just explore the core features quickly

- And much more!
